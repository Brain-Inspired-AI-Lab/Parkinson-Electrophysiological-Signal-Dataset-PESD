# Dataset of physiological signals of cortical basal ganglia network model 
Dataset generated from Cortico-basal-ganglia network for parkinsonian rat model

The computational model of cortico-basal-ganglia is presented by Fleming et al., in the article named "Simulation of Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation Control Schemes for Suppression of Pathological Beta Oscillations in Parkinson's Disease" available at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32194372/
