# Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD) 
Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD) built by Michigan Tech Brain-Inspired AI Lab (https://sites.google.com/mtu.edu/hongyu/)

Dataset generated from Cortico-basal-ganglia network for parkinsonian model. 

The computational model of cortico-basal-ganglia is origniallly presented by Fleming et al., in the article named "Simulation of Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation Control Schemes for Suppression of Pathological Beta Oscillations in Parkinson's Disease" available at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32194372/
